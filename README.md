This case study is of a Social Media company thati s concerned with the growing amount of fake news circulating on its platform.
My objective was to investigare how fake news can be recognized and create a method to identify the same utilising Python.
The process origin point was exploratory data analysis, cleaning the data and classifying fake versus factual news.
The data was explored through Parts of Speech tagging, extraction of named entitities, text processing by cleanning up key columns, sentiment analysis, topic modelling using Latent Dhirichlet Allocation and, the creation of a custom classifier which utilised Logistic Regression to lead me to a Classification report containing details of the accuracy score used to identify the likelihood of Fake versus Factual news.
Techonologies used in this process: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Spacy, NLTK, vaderSentiment, Gensim, SKLearn.
